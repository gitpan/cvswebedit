History
-------

In late 1997 I came across Bill Fenner's cvsweb.pl CGI script.
cvsweb.pl allows a web browser based user to browse a CVS ("Concurrent
Versioning System") repository using a web browser.

I wrote cvswebedit to allow Web Based users to edit files in the
repository, using only a web browser. I released a first version in
February 1998 that allowed users to edit, but not create, files.
Cvswebedit permitted both editing in the browser (for text files) and an
upload/download model for binaries.

This version (v.2.0) of cvswebedit adds some default security tailored for
Apache, the ability to create files or directories and some rudimentary
administrative functions such that an administrator can view the log
files. Security wise, by default anyone can read the repository but only
editors can create or edit files. This version also has much improved 
error messages and, hopefully, clear installation instructions.

Prerequisites
-------------
1) Preferably a UNIX machine running Solaris or Linux. Other UNIXs should work and
   currently you get reduced functionality on PCs running Win95 or NT.
2) An Apache Webserver. (Actually, not strictly true, but I develop only with Apache)
3) The ability to run CGI scripts on your server.  (normally requires admin privilege to set up)
4) CVS on your server, or the ability to install it (you do not need admin privilege)
5) Perl 5.004 or later installed on the machine with the webserver.
6) A willingness to experiment :^)
7) The willingness to give me good feedback!
